# Exploring eBay Car Sales Data
The aim of this project is to clean the data and analyze the included used car listings.

In this project, I've worked with a dataset of used cars from eBay Kleinanzeigen, a classifieds section of the German eBay website.

The dataset was originally scraped and uploaded to Kaggle by user orgesleka. This particular version of datasource was modified and provided as part of the DataQuest Data science course.

This repository contains:
 - [The main project](https://github.com/ricardas-mikelionis/Exploring-eBay-Car-Sales-Data/blob/main/Basics.ipynb) in Jupyter notebook format.
 - [The dataset](https://github.com/ricardas-mikelionis/Exploring-eBay-Car-Sales-Data/blob/main/autos.csv) in .csv format.
